In here we have files with the jsx stuff I think. but then babel(?) compiles it and sends it to the templates directory where it is in vanilla react. Not sure if this is the best way to do it because now for every one file in js here I get another one in the template file, but I will continue doing it this way in my effor to learn about this stuff better.
