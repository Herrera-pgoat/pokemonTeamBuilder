# pokemonTeamBuilder

I am going to use flask framework to create a website that lets a user build pokemon teams. Each pokemon team can have up to 6 pokemon and each user can save multiple teams.

React is going to be used to creae the front end.

Now I need to figure out how to have user save teams. That is the last hurdle I must conquer before this website is finished. Right now you can put in any pokemon and have the table update accordingly
