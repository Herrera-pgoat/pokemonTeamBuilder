# pokemonTeamBuilder

I am going to use flask framework to create a website that lets a user build pokemon teams. Each pokemon team can have up to 6 pokemon and each user can save multiple teams.

React is going to be used to creae the front end.

The user can save teams I don't know why I didn't update this readme when that feature was available.
