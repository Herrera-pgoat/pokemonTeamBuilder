# pokemonTeamBuilder

I am going to use flask framework to create a website that lets a user build pokemon teams. Each pokemon team can have up to 6 pokemon and each user can save multiple teams.

React is going to be used to creae the front end.

So far I am in the beginning of the project! Still at the beginning but now I have a navbar, register screen, and blueprint for how front end will look. I mean I had the blueprint on physical paper before but now it is sort of on the website.
